# RoadsSlidingWindowsAnalysis

This tool is being developed to facilitate the generation of a sliding windows analysis. This tool simplifies the geospatial process, making it more accessible and easier to obtain results. This tool can be used in transportation planning and analysis to anlyize safety, enabling the examination of crash data within each segment. The results obtained from this analysis help identify locations with a high frequency of crashes, highlighting potential high-injury areas.

Results can be used to better visualize crashes along a transportation network. Here are the results from the Washington DC area.
